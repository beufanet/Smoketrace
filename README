SmokeTrace
==========


Description:

    Traceroute sourced monitoring with graphing and reporting.
    
    SmokePing alerts are latency triggered events, SmokeTrace alerts are path
    triggered events.
    
    Future versions could incorporate latency monitoring and MTU monitoring to
    bring this into one tool although I think it's best to keep them seperate.
    SmokePing could be extended to include other OWMAPs so the two tools'
    become more specialised in their respective fields and should aim to
    complement each other not conflict.


Who made it:

    James Bensley <jwbensley@gmail.com>


Why was it Made:  

    A similar concept to the infamous and brilliant SmokePing (http://smokeping.org/),
    but with traceroute!
    
    Every time I receive a SmokePing alert the first thing I do is run
    traceroute/mtr/etc  to see where in the path the loss is occuring.
    If regular traceroutes where being run I would already know this.
              

What is it used for:

    SmokeTrace records the path to a destination (the IP address of the hops
    along the route to the target host) and alerts if an IP in the path changes
    or if the number of hops changes. This is to alert for path changes.


Technical details:

    * Written in PHP for Linux (it maybe altered at a later date to support other
    operating systems, unsure as yet)
    * Uses MySQL as backend not RRD files (testing will commence on MariaDB soon,
    unsure of other DB support as yet)
    * Still in Alpha no code to show as yet!
